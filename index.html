  <p>
  My journey into <l>programming and development </l>has been both exciting and challenging. It began in September and October, when I started learning Python. This versatile and beginner-friendly language introduced me to the world of coding, sparking my passion for technology and its endless possibilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  <l>In November and December</l>, I moved on to Java, a powerful language that plays a significant role in Android app development. Java's object-oriented approach and wide applications fascinated me and helped me strengthen my programming skills.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, due to the lack of a laptop, I shifted my focus in January to learning web development on my phone. While <l>web development </l>has been an interesting field to explore, it is not my ultimate goal. This phase taught me resilience and adaptability, as I found ways to continue learning despite the limitations.
  <br>
  <br>
  My true aspiration lies in<l> Android app development and AI development.</l> I dream of creating smart, user-friendly apps that merge innovation and intelligence to solve real-world problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Every step of this journey has been a learning experience, and I am determined to keep pushing forward, overcoming challenges, and achieving my goals.
