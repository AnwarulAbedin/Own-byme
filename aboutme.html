  <h1>Welcome Back</h1>
<div id="container">
    <p>I am Anwarul Abedin, a Class 9 student at Crescent Public School, studying under the CBSE Board. Despite being in Class 9, I have advanced far beyond my grade level in academics. I have completed Mathematics up to the 12th Class, showcasing my passion and aptitude for the subject. My dedication to mathematics is further reflected in my achievement of qualifying the Indian Olympiad Qualifier in Mathematics (IOQM),a prestigious milestone for aspiring mathematicians.

<br>

<br>
Apart from Mathematics, my favorite subjects include Physics and Chemistry. I have already studied Physics up to Class 11, and my knowledge of Chemistry extends to Class 10. My interest in these subjects fuels my curiosity and inspires me to excel academically. With a strong foundation in the sciences and a relentless drive to learn, I aim to continue exploring and mastering these fields.
